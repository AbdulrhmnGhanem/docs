In that case the extension will always use that version of Julia. To edit your configuration settings, execute the Preferences: Open User Settings command (you can also access it via the menu File->Preferences->Settings), and then make sure your user settings include the julia.executablePath setting. The format of the string should follow your platform specific conventions, and be aware that the backlash \\ is the escape character in JSON, so you need to use \\\\ as the path separator character on Windows.","category":"page"},{"location":"userguide/remote/#Remote-Development-1","page":"Remote Development","title":"Remote Development","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/tasks/#Tasks-1","page":"Tasks","title":"Tasks","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/grid/#Data-Grid-1","page":"Data Grid","title":"Data Grid","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/formatter/#Formatting-Code-1","page":"Formatting Code","title":"Formatting Code","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/linter/#Linter-1","page":"Linter","title":"Linter","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"gettingstarted/#Getting-Started-1","page":"Getting Started","title":"Getting Started","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/plotgallery/#Plot-Gallery-1","page":"Plot Gallery","title":"Plot Gallery","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/codenavigation/#Code-Navigation-1","page":"Code Navigation","title":"Code Navigation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/codenavigation/#Open-Package-Directory-1","page":"Code Navigation","title":"Open Package Directory","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/codenavigation/#Goto-Definition-1","page":"Code Navigation","title":"Goto Definition","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/codenavigation/#Symbols-1","page":"Code Navigation","title":"Symbols","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/runningcode/#Running-Code-1","page":"Running Code","title":"Running Code","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/weave/#Julia-Markdown-Documents-1","page":"Julia Markdown Documents","title":"Julia Markdown Documents","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#Home-1","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/settings/#Settings-1","page":"Settings","title":"Settings","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"userguide/env/#Julia-Environments-1","page":"Julia Environments","title":"Julia Environments","text":"","category":"section"}]

In that case the extension will always use that version of julia. To edit your configuration settings, execute the Preferences: Open User Settings command (you can also access it via the menu File->Preferences->Settings), and then make sure your user settings include the julia.executablePath setting. The format of the string should follow your platform specific conventions, and be aware that the backlash \\ is the escape character in JSON, so you need to use \\\\ as the path separator character on Windows.","category":"page"}]

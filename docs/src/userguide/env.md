# Julia Environments

The **status bar** displays the active Julia environment. The **status bar** enables you to change between multiple Julia environments, or versions of Julia. 

For example, if you have a project open in VSCode and you are currently working in v 1.4 (Julia env: 1.4) and want to switch to v 1.5 (Julia env: 1.5), follow the instructions below: 

1. Click on the **status bar** where `Julia env: v1.4` is displayed and a drop down appears with global environments that are avaliable to you.
2. Select the `v 1.5` environment.  Your active Julia environment is Julia 1.5. 

Switching between different enviornments enables you to use different packages that are avaliable to you in VSCode such as code completion.

# Julia VS Code extension v0.17 release

Welcome to the v0.17 release of the Julia VS Code extension.

## Global variable support in the debugger variable explorer

[TODO SP]

## Debug and run buttons above Julia files

We added a run and debug button above the file editor area when you open a Julia file that makes it easier to run the currently active file:

## Support for step in targets in the debugger

[TODO SP]

## Profile viewing support

We added new functionality that allows you to save profiling results in a `*.cpuprofile` file. Recent versions of VS Code have built-in support to analyze and visualize these profiling result files.

The easiest way to use this functionality is the `@profview` macro, which executes your code under the Julia profiler and then saves the results as a `*.cpuprofile` file. To use it, start a Julia REPL, and then call `@profview` like this:

```julia
julia> @profview my_function_that_should_be_profiled()
```

Alternatively you can call the function `view_profile` in the REPL which will save the profiling results from the previous profiling session.

Once you have created a `*.cpuprofile` file with one of these methods, you can open it in VS Code. The initial view shown is a tabular display of the profiling results. The search bar at the top allows you to filter the profiling results and provides a rich [query language](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-profile-visualizer/blob/master/query-language.md) for more advanced queries:

You can also look at the same information in a flamegraph by clicking the little fire button next to the search area. The first time you do so, you will be asked to install another extension, go ahead and do that. The flamegraph visualization then looks like this:
